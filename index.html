            It was a warm summer day in Central Park. A busker was singing ‘Ave Maria’. Just a few steps away a violinist was bowing ‘Here Comes the Bride'. Stephanie Lait, 28 at the time, walked into the park wearing a fishtail dress with a train and veil, holding a bouquet of fake flowers. She was about to become Stephanie McManus. She, and her soon to be husband, Rob McManus, 30, had been together for 11 years. They had travelled from Sheffield, England to elope in Central Park. The sound of children laughing, the smell of pretzels and hot dogs wafted through the air- it was perfect.</p>
              
       
<p>New York City has long been a destination for couples from around the world to tie the knot but since COVID, elopements have soared. In a city where the average wedding costs $75,000 but the wedding license itself costs $25, couples are reimagining what a meaningful wedding looks like.</p>
              
<p>In the post-COVID world prices and demands continued to surge leaving many couples looking for alternatives. Taking from the lessons of the pandemic and fueled by social media, elopements, which once elicited shock and evoked feelings of rebellion, scandal and cheap spontaneity, now caters to pragmatists and romantics. 
Though, long before the pandemic disrupted wedding plans and couples turned to stoops and parks for barebone, masked ceremonies, the elopement market in Central Park had solidified itself as a significant microcosm of the behemoth wedding industry.</p>
<p>“ In 2020 we did so many weddings between August and November that year and they were all planned in like six weeks,” Christa DeHuff, owner of A Central Park Wedding said. </p>
<p>The specialists for Central Park elopements fall in a few different categories as do their clientele. DeHuff, whose company caters to all inquiries that come through CentralPark.com, has been planning weddings in the park for 13 years. In the beginning she primarily assisted foreigners eloping in the park. These days her business deals mostly with locals. “It used to be like I only had like 25% local couples, and now I think it's probably like 75%.” Dehuff says “I mean, nowadays everyone calls a small wedding an elopement. So it's like the definition has kind of shifted from like a true elopement where it was just a couple,” DeHuff, whose prices average around $5,500 says.</p>
<p>Nicki Fietzer, owner of De Nueva Photography, has seen a demographic shift in her clientele. When she began in 2012 most of her clients were coming from abroad or were same-sex couples travelling from Southern states until the Marriage Equality Act in 2015. After COVID the demographic shifted, “It's a much bigger mix of locals versus couples coming from abroad,” Fietzer says. </p>
          
          
            
<p>In 2024 her business had an influx of same sex couples that worried the Marriage Equality Act would be repealed under the Trump administration. “I think New York City makes it very easy for people coming from out of town to get married because there's only the 24-hour waiting period,” Fietzer says. She recommends early morning weddings at sunrise to avoid the crowds. Her images can take on an almost surreal effect as a result, seeing a couple alone in the park in their wedding clothes drenched in golden light from the rising sun- no one else in sight. </p>

                    }
            }
        });
    })();

<p>Although elopements are small it doesn’t mean they can’t come with a hefty price tag. “You can definitely spend a lot of money on an elopement. But then I think you're spending it on the experience rather than on spending it on, you know, chicken for 200 people, “says Fietzer who charges $875 for a one-hour elopement.</p>
           
<p>Clair Ady, who started her business Wed in Central Park in 2012, after she herself eloped in the park, primarily deals with foreigners, many from England, where outdoor weddings are rare and considered exotic and unique. </p>
          
<p>“If you are English and the only weddings you've been to are indoors and then you think, oh, I can get married with that backdrop of those New York skyscrapers and the trees and the lake and all that stuff that's so iconic… It just feels like it's so very, very New York,” Ady says. In 2022, she planned 82 weddings, post pandemic but most years does 50-70 weddings in the park, mostly elopements with a growing number of vow renewals. </p>

<p>Cheryn Howard and her husband Kyle Howard are in their 50s, with grown kids and elderly parents. They met in a country western dance hall in Austin, Texas and eloped five years later. A second marriage was an opportunity for an adventure- Europe? Two days of travel and a mountain of paperwork didn’t seem worth the hassle. </p>

<p>The two had never been to New York together and Howard, who had had the big wedding the first time around, liked the simplicity of an all-inclusive package. True pragmatists, they picked Veterans Day to wed so they would always have a three-day weekend to celebrate anniversaries. The fall leaves were their backdrop in the Lady’s Pavillion, and the city was already adorned in Christmas lights. It all spelled out romance. “Because of our family being elderly, we didn't want them to feel like they were obligated to come to the wedding.  So, we just sort of decided, well, let's just elope and then no one will feel bad that they couldn't come, “Howard said. “I really liked that we didn't have to worry about anybody else that day except ourselves.” Her first wedding had been expensive, unpredictable and elaborate. </p>

<p>The couple spend in total $10,000 for their week in New York, including plane tickets, hotels, sightseeing and shows, dining out at fancy vegan restaurants and of course their wedding. “It definitely was cheaper and easier and more streamlined,” Howard says and most importantly, “Way less stressful. So, we were able to do what we wanted to do and not have to think of, well, what would our guests like to do? “</p>

<p>The McManus’ trip to New York to elope in Central Park checked several boxes; avoiding complex family dynamics, her husband had never been to New York, being shy, a honeymoon and adventure. Seeing the park on the big screen it seemed like a dream to be married there. 
The two took out a 0% APR credit card knowing it would be used up on the wedding. Purchasing a hotel room for two weeks in midtown, upgraded plane tickets, site seeing passes and tickets to some shows, a boat ride to see the 4th of July fireworks, a day in Coney Island. </p>
<p>They had considered a beach destination like the Canary Islands but wanted more to do besides the wedding itself. “A lot of those beautiful scenic places they don't tend to have much to do other than laying in the sun,” McManus said a year later wrapped up in a blanket in her Sheffield home, now 18 weeks pregnant. The McManus’ spent a total of around £15,000 (around $19,000USD) on the two weeks in New York.
They hope to visit New York soon, in the next five years but in the meantime the couple is paying off the credit card and preparing for their baby, “ We're in the debt wheel, McManus says, “Absolutely worth it. I do it all again in a heartbeat. We want to go back to New York as soon as possible.”
